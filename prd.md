The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of the GhostNote website.

| Requirement ID | Description              | User Story                                                                                                | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Creating a New Message   | As a user, I want to be able to input a message and a display username to post it publicly but anonymously. | The system should provide text areas for the message content and a desired display username, along with a button to submit the post.                                                 |
| FR002          | Saving Message Content   | As a user, when I submit my message, I want it saved along with my chosen username and the creation date.   | Upon submission, the system saves the message content, the provided username, and the current timestamp. It then generates a unique identifier (URL) for accessing this message. |
| FR003          | Generating Mod Code      | As a user, when my message is saved, I want to receive a unique modification code so I can edit or delete it later. | After saving, the system should display the unique URL for the message *and* a separate, unique modification code required for future changes or deletion.                           |
| FR004          | Viewing Specific Message | As a user, I want to be able to view the content, username, and creation date of a message by visiting its unique URL. | When a user accesses a valid message URL, the system should display the corresponding message content, the username provided at creation, and the creation timestamp.             |
| FR005          | Editing Saved Message    | As a user, I want to be able to edit the content of a message I previously created, using its modification code. | The system should provide an interface on the message view page (e.g., an 'Edit' button triggering a prompt) to input the modification code and update the message content.        |
| FR006          | Deleting Saved Message   | As a user, I want to be able to delete a message I previously created, using its modification code.       | The system should provide a mechanism on the message view page (e.g., a 'Delete' button triggering a prompt) that requires the modification code to permanently delete the message. |
| FR007          | Sharing Message Link     | As a user, I want to easily copy the unique URL of my saved message so I can share it with others.        | The system should display the generated URL clearly after creation, potentially with a "copy link" button.                                                                             |
| FR008          | Handling Lost Code       | As a user, if I lose the modification code, I understand I will not be able to edit or delete my message.   | Messages without a provided valid modification code should remain viewable (read-only) but cannot be altered or deleted through the standard user interface.                          |
| FR009          | Viewing Random Message   | As a user, I want a way to discover and view a random message posted by someone else on the platform.     | The system should provide a feature (e.g., a "View Random Message" button/link on the homepage) that navigates the user to the URL of a randomly selected, existing message.       |
